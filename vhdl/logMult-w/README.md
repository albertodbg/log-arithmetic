This is an 8x8 logartihmic multiplier using the truncated Mitchell's algorithm shown in

Neural Networks," in IEEE Transactions on Computers. doi: 10.1109/TC.2018.2880742
Note that the paper names this as Mitch-w in order to avoid the confusion with the characteristic representation (k)

This version unbias the operands.
